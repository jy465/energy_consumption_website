For this project, i built  a simple tgree-page website using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.
Instead of GitHub Copilot, i used ChatGPT to guide me through creating the struture of this website.
ChatGPT also helped me understand how basic JavaScript works. 
Through this experience, I learned how these technologies work together to make a website faster.
