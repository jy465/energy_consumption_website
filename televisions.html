      <h2>Energy-Saving Tips for Televisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose an energy-efficient model with a high star rating.</li>
        <li>Turn off the TV when not in use instead of leaving it on standby.</li>
        <li>Reduce screen brightness to lower energy consumption.</li>
        <li>Use a power strip to easily turn off multiple devices at once.</li>
        <li>Consider using a smaller screen size if it meets your viewing needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example annual consumption in Australia:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>32-inch LED TV: ~60–80 kWh per year (≈ $20–25 electricity cost)</li>
        <li>55-inch LED TV: ~120–150 kWh per year (≈ $40–50 electricity cost)</li>
        <li>65-inch OLED TV: ~180–220 kWh per year (≈ $65–75 electricity cost)</li>
      <h4>*Costs based on Australian average electricity price of ~$0.30 per kWh.
